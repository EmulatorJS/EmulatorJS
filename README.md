**As of EmulatorJS version 4.0, this project is no longer a reverse-engineered version of the emulatorjs.com project. It is now a complete re-write,**

<br>

**README BEFORE YOU UPDATE:** EmulatorJS Version 4.0 is a complete re-write of the application. At least some bugs are expected. If you did any communicating with the emulator, there is a 100% chance you will need to re-write your project, and to people with active branches of this project, I wish you luck with merge conflicts (I'm very sorry). The emulator object can be accessed through the `window.EJS_emulator` object.

It is **HIGHLY** suggested that you update to 4.0 ASAP.

***PSP is not yet supported***. Some of y'all may have seen that I pushed a "beta" ppsspp core, but this core is not ready for daily use. It still crashes randomly and any games that use 3d (so like, all of them) will just have a white screen (and might just crash). Do not open issues related to the "psp" core.
