## Attention Visual Studio Code Users

By default Visual Studio Code will apply formatting that is not consistent with the standard formatting used by this project.

Please disable the formatter *before* submitting a Pull Request.

The formatter can be disabled for this repo only (without affecting your own preferences) by creating a new file called `.vscode/settings.json` (if it doesn't already exist).

Add the following options to the settings.json file to disable the formatter while working on this repo:
```json
{
    "diffEditor.ignoreTrimWhitespace": false,
    "editor.formatOnPaste": false,
    "editor.formatOnSave": false,
    "editor.formatOnSaveMode": "modifications"
}
```
